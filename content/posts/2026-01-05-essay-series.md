In continuing to have something to write about, I came up with two (self-claimed) brilliant ideas of essay series. The first one is I'm going to randomly pick essay prompts from GRE tests and answer them as truthfully as possible, which probably won't be what's usually expected in these kind of essays. Secondly, I'm going to randomly pick regular essay prompts to write serious short essay about, the point is even regular topics can be interesting and maybe even deep. 

I'm super pumped for this! Let's do this!
